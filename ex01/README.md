# Exercise 1: Basic Serialization and Deserialization with JSON

In this exercise, you'll use the Serde crate to serialize and deserialize a custom 'Point' struct using JSON.

# Task Description

1. Open the `src/main.rs` file in your preferred code editor.
2. Explore the `Point` struct.
3. Consider test cases in the `tests` module.
4. Read the [description of the Serde derive macro](https://serde.rs/derive.html).
5. Try to implement it in `/* Place your code here */` section!
6. Once you've implemented serialization and deserialization, run the tests: `cargo test`
